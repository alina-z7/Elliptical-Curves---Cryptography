# Elliptical-Curves-and-Cryptography

## Overview
This project explores Elliptical Curves and their Applications in Modern Cryptosystems like El Gamal, and its implementation in code.

## What are Elliptical Curves?

The set of solutions to a Weierstrass equation is an **elliptic curve**. 

        Weierstrass Equation: Y^2 = X^3 + AX + B

(A and B must be constants that satisfy the property 4A^3 + 27B^2 /= 0.)

**Ideal Point**: a point defined on the projective plane at infinity

So why is this information important?

There is a property in which any two points on a elliptic curve will yield a third point by doing a special operation called "adding" (entirely different from +).

Here are some example elliptical curves:
